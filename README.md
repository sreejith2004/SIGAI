# Dataset Analysis :bar_chart:

</div>

This project aims to analyze a given dataset and apply different preprocessing techniques to enhance it.

## :white_check_mark: Task Completion

1. :arrow_down: Download the Dataset: The dataset has been downloaded and stored in the `data` directory of this repository.

2. :package: Import `pandas` and `numpy`: The pandas and numpy modules have been imported in the Python script.

3. :file_folder: Load and Analyze the Dataset: The dataset has been loaded using pandas, and the first few rows as well as statistical analysis have been displayed.

4. :chart_with_upwards_trend: Graphical Comparison and Analysis: The `matplotlib`'s `pyplot` module has been used to plot four different graphs comparing and analyzing various features (columns) of the dataset. The plots can be found in the `plots` directory.

5. :x: Handling Null Values: Null values in the dataset have been checked, and any rows with null values have been removed.

6. :gear: Preprocessing Techniques: The dataset has been preprocessed using the normalization technique from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. This approach scales the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. A brief explanation of the chosen technique is provided in the script.

7. :chart: Correlation Matrix: The correlation matrix of the dataset has been calculated and displayed.

## :sparkles: Advanced Deliverables

1. :robot: Machine Learning Algorithm: An optional step was implemented using the `sklearn` module to apply a machine learning algorithm of choice to the preprocessed dataset. The details of the chosen algorithm and its implementation can be found in the script.

2. :dart: Accuracy and Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE) of the machine learning model have been calculated and displayed.

3. :rocket: Gradio and HuggingFace Deployment: An optional step was completed to deploy the machine learning model using Gradio and HuggingFace. The details and code for deployment can be found in the script.

## Repository and About Me

:star: I am Sreejith P, currently studying in Amrita College of Engineering, Amritapuri. I belong to the S2 EAC batch and I am interested in joining the SIGAI club to explore the fascinating field of artificial intelligence.

### :outbox_tray: Output File

The output file generated from the analysis and preprocessing tasks can be found in the repository at the following location: `output/output_file.csv`.

Please refer to the Python script in the repository for the complete implementation details and code samples.
